Mu is a frontend for text-based sheet music engraving written in Haskell.

### Goals

Integrate with existing sheet music engraving systems (LilyPond, etc.) using an elegant and expressive type-safe DSL.

### Why Haskell?

Haskell has some strengths that are particularly well-suited to the representation and manipulation of music. For example, Haskell's algebraic data types allow programmers to safely express complex hierarchical relationships, which are commonly found in music representation.
