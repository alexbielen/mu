# Mu

![Mu Logo](images/mu_chord.png)

Mu is an algorithmic music composition toolbox written in Haskell. Mu is a work-in-progress and will be for quite some time. APIs should not be considered stable!

### Goals

Mu aims to be a one-stop interface for algorithmic music composition. This includes the following goals:

- Provide a type-safe, expressive, and easy-to-learn algorithmic music composition library.
- Support realtime and faster-than-realtime in equal measure.
- Integrate with various input and output musical representations including MIDI, CSound, MusicXML, MICA (Music Information Concept Archive), and others.
- Provide previously unexplored types of parametric transformations including easing/tweening capabilities, collective behavior/swarming algorithms, and others.

### Why Haskell?

I believe that Haskell is uniquely suited to algorithmic music composition. Haskell's expressive syntax allows for quick realtime manipulation while its elegant type system affords confidence in performance and reliability. Haskell's algebraic and logical foundations afford easy-to-understand design of algorithmic heavy applications.
