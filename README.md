Mu is an algorithmic music composition toolbox written in Haskell. Mu is a work-in-progress and will be for quite some time. APIs should not be considered stable!

### Goals

- Integrate with existing systems for sound synthesis, sheet music engraving, etc. The algorithmic music composition software ecosystem is strong!
- Support realtime and non-realtime in equal measure.
- Explore new types of transformation and integrate research from collective behavior/swarming.

### Why Haskell?

Haskell has some strengths that are particularly well-suited to algorithmic music composition. Haskell's expressive syntax allows for quick realtime manipulation while its elegant type system affords confidence in performance and reliability. Haskell's algebraic and logical foundations afford easy-to-understand design of algorithmic heavy applications.
